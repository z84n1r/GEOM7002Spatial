Course Description: Thiscourse   develops   skill   and   a   deeper   understanding   to   conduct   detaild   analysisin   geographicalinformation   systems   (GIS)
using   basic statistical   methodsand spatial analysis.Students   learn to analyse   spatial   patterns   and   relate these   to   processes   inthe   natural
environment   andhuman   spatial   behaviour.Students   also   gain   knowledge   and   skils to   develop   geoprocessing   modelsand for   makingdecisions   related to planning and   management.
Assumed Background:Students are expected to   have completed aGIS   course(GEOM2001   or   GEOM2002)or   demonstrated   equivalentlearning   and   experience.
1.2 Course Introduction 
This course   is designed to build on and   extend the   knowledgeand   skils   thatstudents   acquired   in   a   GIS   introductory   course   or   through   their
experience using GIs elsewhere.It focus on various spatial   analysis   and   modelling   techniques   and   geo-visualisation for   applications   relating   to   the   natural and built environments and   human   activities.
Lectures present concepts and give examples for analysing   spatial   data   toaddress   common   problems   concerning   the   physical   and   human
geographical   processes,patterns   and   relationships.Students work   onexample   problems   inpracticals   using   GIS.Assessment   is   based   upon   1)one   project which consists of a project proposal and   a   report,2)oneusing   StoryMap   to   communicating   GIS   data   and   analysis   to   non-expert   audiences;      and   3)a   final   exam
Course Changes in Response to Previous Student Feedback 
In   response to the technological   development   in thefeld   we   are   migratingfrom   desktop   GIS(ArcGIS)to   ArcGIS   Proin   the   practicalsin   this   course.

2.1 Course Aims 
This course aims to equip   students with:
1)             advanced   knowledge and skills in   spatial   analysisand   modelling   using   GIS;and
2)             applied spatial skills to use GIS   to   address   geographical,environmental   and   planning   problems   in   the   real world.
